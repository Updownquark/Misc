Design:
	When funds or processes are added to groups, funds/processes in the same group should be stacked in the timeline.
	Add ability to view multiple timelines at once (configurable), each with a configurable type (balances/income) and set of plans
		Plan no longer extends VisibleEntity
	Scale markers in timeline
	Optional (collapsible) zoomed view in timeline for a sub-period
	Need to restructure UI to give more space to timeline(s)

Bugs:
	Local variables table does not resize automatically when process selection changes
	Test layout/behavior for fresh installation

Implementation:
	Removing things
	Adding things double
	Adding things to groups
	Enable dragging for reordering in tables and tree
	+/- buttons in tree
	Need groups?
	Need stippling?
	Delete key in tree
