Design:
	Parse money/instant/durations in variable/fund editor expression fields without accents
	When funds or processes are added to groups, funds/processes in the same group should be stacked in the timeline.
	Add ability to view multiple timelines at once (configurable), each with a configurable type (balances/income) and set of plans
		Plan no longer extends VisibleEntity
	Scale markers in timeline
	Optional (collapsible) zoomed view in timeline for a sub-period
	Need to restructure UI to give more space to timeline(s)
	Make an activity boolean (maybe an expression) for processes
	Need visualization in fund editor timeline of which processes are contributing over time

Bugs:
	Local variables table does not resize automatically when process selection changes
	When variable is renamed, processes that use it say 'vbl' cannot be resolved to a variable
	Suppress System.err output for expression parsing
	Test layout/behavior for fresh installation
	Dragging and dropping variables (and probably actions) in a process table resets the variable names to persisted
	null color renders black in timelines, but shows up as white in the editor

Implementation:
	Removing things
	Adding things double
	Adding things to groups
	Enable dragging for reordering in tables and tree
	+/- buttons in tree
	Forbid use of 'CurrentDate', 'PlanStart' as an identifier everywhere
